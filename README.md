## What I Do (The Professional Bit)

I'm that person who gets genuinely excited about cleaning messy datasets and finding the story hidden in spreadsheets. Currently pursuing my MS in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University, where I spend my days convincing professors that yes, analyzing skincare sales data IS a legitimate research project.

**The Numbers Don't Lie:**
- Boosted workflow efficiency by 15% (because who doesn't love optimization?)
- Reduced processing errors by 25% (goodbye, data nightmares)
- Improved client retention by 30% through the magic of data-driven insights

Previously worked as a Business Analyst at Maharaj Multi-Systems and Data Analytics Intern at Pimpri Chinchwad Media Communication. I specialize in turning "we have too much data" problems into "wow, look what we discovered" solutions.

**What I'm really good at:**
- Making SQL queries that actually work on the first try (okay, maybe the third)
- Creating Tableau dashboards that don't make people's eyes bleed
- Explaining why correlation doesn't imply causation (for the millionth time)
- Finding patterns in data that others call "random noise"
